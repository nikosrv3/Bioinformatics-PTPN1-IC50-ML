# Bioinformatics-PTPN1-IC50-ML
This project would not have been possible without the educational resources from "the data professor" and his bioinformatics educational resources found at: https://github.com/dataprofessor/bioinformatics_freecodecamp/

End Goal:
Webapp that takes in ChEMBL data for a molecule (or number of molecules) and outputs its predicted bioactivity(IC50 value) on PTPN1.

Current Status:
- Training data collected
- data cleaned and preprocessed
- exploratory data analysis
- parameter selection
- model training / testing
- model creation / final selection

In Progress:
- Flask backend
- React frontend
